            <p> This project features a collection of 3D low-poly building models, showcasing simplicity in design while maintaining visual appeal. The low-poly style emphasizes clean geometry and minimal detail, making these models suitable for stylized games, animations, or visualizations.</p>

                <p class="image-description">The low-poly building models were created using default cube objects in Blender. The process involved several key steps to shape the structures:

                    Scaling and rotating the cube to achieve the desired proportions.
                    Extensive use of inset (intrude) and extrude tools to define features like windows, doors, and other architectural details.
                    Iterative adjustments to ensure each building maintained a consistent low-poly style while still looking distinct.
                    This straightforward yet effective approach highlights the creative possibilities of simple geometry and basic modeling techniques.</p>

                <p class="image-description">For texturing, I used simple colors and applied separate materials to various parts of the buildings to achieve a clean and minimalistic look. This included:

                    Assigning different colors to key elements such as building walls, window borders, and borders for a stylized and consistent aesthetic.
                    Keeping the materials basic yet effective, enhancing the low-poly charm without overwhelming the design.
                    This approach allowed for clear distinction between different pa</p>

                    Throughout this project, I learned valuable techniques for creating buildings in Blender, including modeling, texturing, and rendering low-poly structures. This process enhanced my understanding of architectural design and how to achieve a clean, visually appealing aesthetic in a 3D environment.</p>
