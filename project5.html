            <p>This project is titled 3D Tree Model and focuses on using realistic textures to create a lifelike appearance. The images below showcase the process of texturing and highlight how adding detailed textures enhances the tree model, bringing it to life.</p>

                <p class="image-description">This image demonstrates the process of creating a tree using the Sapling Tree Add-on in Blender. By experimenting with the add-on’s settings, I was able to achieve a tree structure that met my requirements.

                    Key steps included:
                    
                    Adjusting the leaves settings, initially set to a low value (1) for simplicity, and then increasing it to a higher value to densely populate the branches.
                    Fine-tuning other parameters within the add-on to create a natural and visually appealing tree structure.
                    This approach allowed for efficient customization, resulting in a tree that closely resembles a realistic form.</p>

                <p class="image-description">The images above showcase the branch and leaves textures applied to the tree model. The textures were added using the Shader Editor in Blender, with the following key steps:

                    Imported the texture using an Image Texture Node.
                    Used Mapping and Texture Coordinate Nodes to properly align and scale the textures on the branches and leaves.
                    Adjusted the settings to ensure the textures blended seamlessly, creating a natural and realistic look.
                    This process highlights the importance of precise texturing techniques to bring depth and realism to the tree model.</p>

                <p class="image-description">This image highlights the trunk texture applied to the tree model. The process involved the following steps:

                    Added the texture using Image Texture Nodes in the Shader Editor.
                    Incorporated the Mapping Node to adjust the placement, scale, and rotation of the texture for a precise fit.
                    Performed UV Unwrapping on the trunk model to ensure the texture aligned correctly with the geometry.
                    Once all the nodes were connected properly and settings adjusted, the texture seamlessly wrapped around the trunk, enhancing the model’s realistic appearance.</p>

                <p class="image-description">The image above showcases the final rendered output of the tree model, exuding realistic tree vibes. Through meticulous texturing, lighting adjustments, and careful rendering settings, the model achieves a lifelike appearance that brings the tree to life.

                    This final render highlights the culmination of the entire process, from creating the structure to applying textures and fine-tuning the details for a realistic result.</p>
