        <div class="project-details">
            <p>This project is called 3D Isometric Bedroom Model because it uses isometric perspective, which is produced by angling the camera to create the ideal view. Items in the scene include a wooden drawer, a bed, a shelf, pictures, books, and a plant. The majority of the items were made with default primitives, such as cylinders and cubes. The pieces were shaped and refined using bevel and mirror modifiers to provide a polished and unified appearance.</p>

                <img src="pic/pro1/pro1.1.png" alt="Project 1 Image 1">
                <p class="image-description">This image showcases the base model, which currently lacks color. However, every object is properly aligned, and their positions have been carefully checked in preparation for the next steps, such as applying materials and adding colors.</p>

                <p class="image-description">This image showcases the model with detailed colors and lighting. In this process, the same color materials can be applied to different objects, such as the planks on the floor and the wall borders. These adjustments are made using the Shading Editor in Blender.</p>

                <img src="pic/pro1/pro1.3.png" alt="Project 1 Image 3">
                <p class="image-description">This scene highlights the camera position. To achieve an isometric view, specific X, Y, and Z values can be set for the camera position, or the Isometric Camera add-on in Blender can be used to simplify the process. Lighting and camera placement are crucial for visualizing the model effectively. In this project, I utilized area lights, point lights, and emission materials on the lamp to create the desired lighting effects. The area light was positioned to illuminate the overall scene, while point lights were added to highlight specific objects or areas that were not adequately lit by the area light.</p>

                <p class="image-description">The final rendered image embodies a cartoonish yet polished aesthetic. The isometric perspective, combined with vibrant colors and carefully positioned lighting, brings the scene to life. The interplay of lighting and shadows enhances the model's depth, making it visually appealing and immersive.</p>
